      The FIFA World Cup, often simply called the World Cup, is an international
      association football competition among the senior men's national teams of
      the members of the Fédération Internationale de Football Association
      (FIFA), the sport's global governing body. The tournament has been held
      every four years since the inaugural tournament in 1930, with the
      exception of 1942 and 1946 due to the Second World War. The reigning
      champions are Argentina, who won their third title at the 2022
      tournament.[1] The contest starts with the qualification phase, which
      takes place over the preceding three years to determine which teams
      qualify for the tournament phase. In the tournament phase, 32 teams
      compete for the title at venues within the host nation(s) over the course
      of about a month. The host nation(s) automatically qualify for the group
      stage of the tournament. The competition is scheduled to expand to 48
      teams, starting with the 2026 tournament. As of the 2022 FIFA World Cup,
      22 final tournaments have been held since the event's inception in 1930,
      and a total of 80 national teams have competed. The trophy has been won by
      eight national teams. Brazil, with five wins, are the only team to have
      played in every tournament. The other World Cup winners are Germany and
      Italy, with four titles each; Argentina, with three titles; France and
      inaugural winner Uruguay, each with two titles; and England and Spain,
      with one title each. The World Cup is the most prestigious association
      football tournament in the world, as well as the most widely viewed and
      followed single sporting event in the world.[2][3] The viewership of the
      2018 World Cup was estimated to be 3.57 billion, close to half of the
      global population,[4][5] while the engagement with the 2022 World Cup was
      estimated to be 5 billion, with about 1.5 billion people watching the
      final match.[6] Seventeen countries have hosted the World Cup, most
      recently Qatar, who hosted the 2022 event. The 2026 tournament will be
      jointly hosted by Canada, the United States and Mexico, which will give
      Mexico the distinction of being the first country to host games in three
      World Cups. History Main article: History of the FIFA World Cup Previous
      international competitions The world's first international football match
      was a challenge match played in Glasgow in 1872 between Scotland and
      England.[7] The first international tournament for nations, the inaugural
      British Home Championship, took place in 1884 and included games between
      England, Scotland, Wales, and Ireland.[8] As football grew in popularity
      in other parts of the world at the start of the 20th century, it was held
      as a demonstration sport with no medals awarded at the 1900 and 1904
      Summer Olympics; however, the International Olympic Committee has
      retroactively upgraded their status to official events, as well as the
      1906 Intercalated Games.[9] After FIFA was founded in 1904, it tried to
      arrange an international football tournament between nations outside the
      Olympic framework in Switzerland in 1906. These were very early days for
      international football, and the official history of FIFA describes the
      competition as having been unsuccessful.[10] At the 1908 Summer Olympics
      in London, football became an official Olympic sport. Planned by The
      Football Association (FA), England's football governing body, the event
      was for amateur players only and was regarded suspiciously as a show
      rather than a competition. Great Britain (represented by the England
      national amateur football team) won the gold medals. They repeated the
      feat at the 1912 Summer Olympics in Stockholm.[11] With the Olympic event
      continuing to be a contest between amateur teams only, Sir Thomas Lipton
      organised the Sir Thomas Lipton Trophy tournament in Turin in 1909. The
      Lipton tournament was a championship between individual clubs (not
      national teams) from different nations, each of which represented an
      entire nation. The competition is sometimes described as The First World
      Cup,[12] and featured the most prestigious professional club sides from
      Italy, Germany and Switzerland, but the FA of England refused to be
      associated with the competition and declined the offer to send a
      professional team. Lipton invited West Auckland, an amateur side from
      County Durham, to represent England instead. West Auckland won the
      tournament and returned in 1911 to successfully defend their title.[13]
      Prior to the Lipton competition, from 1876 to 1904, games that were
      considered to be the "football world championship" were meetings between
      leading English and Scottish clubs, such as the 1895 game between
      Sunderland A.F.C. and the Heart of Midlothian F.C., which Sunderland
      won.[14] In 1914, FIFA agreed to recognise the Olympic tournament as a
      "world football championship for amateurs", and took responsibility for
      managing the event.[15] This paved the way for the world's first
      intercontinental football competition for nations, at the 1920 Summer
      Olympics, contested by Egypt and 13 European teams, and won by
      Belgium.[16] Uruguay won the next two Olympic football tournaments in 1924
      and 1928. Those were also the first two open world championships, as 1924
      was the start of FIFA's professional era, and is the reason why Uruguay is
      allowed to wear 4 stars.[17][18] World Cups before World War II Due to the
      success of the Olympic football tournaments, FIFA, with President Jules
      Rimet as the driving force, again started looking at staging its own
      international tournament outside of the Olympics. On 28 May 1928, the FIFA
      Congress in Amsterdam decided to stage a world championship.[19] With
      Uruguay now two-time official football world champions and to celebrate
      their centenary of independence in 1930, FIFA named Uruguay as the host
      country of the inaugural World Cup tournament.[20] The national
      associations of selected nations were invited to send a team, but the
      choice of Uruguay as a venue for the competition meant a long and costly
      trip across the Atlantic Ocean for European sides, especially in the midst
      of the Great Depression. As such, no European country pledged to send a
      team until two months before the start of the competition. Rimet
      eventually persuaded teams from Belgium, France, Romania, and Yugoslavia
      to make the trip.[20] In total, 13 nations took part: seven from South
      America, four from Europe, and two from North America.[21] Due to the
